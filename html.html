    <p style="font-size: 25px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; padding: 0 7em 2em 0">All computer operating systems have vulnerabilities that are targeted by are subject to security risks.In a networked environment, such as a college campus, a compromised computer can
      affect other computers and disrupt services throughout the campus, personal information can be compromised leading to identity theft and intellectual property can be stolen. In order to reduce the risk of a successful
      intrusion and to minimize the damage that can be done, this document provides you with an overview of the fundamental steps and procedures to be followed to minimize security exposures and resulting disruptions.</p>
    
    <h2> Desktop security </h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large; padding: 0 7em 2em 0">One method used in desktop hacking is shoulder surfing. This is when an unnoticed individual looks over your shoulder to obtain private information like your user name and password. The best way to fend off this hack is to physically position your computer
      so that you can see all persons that might be able to look at the keyboard, monitor, or screen of your computer. If you can’t move the computer, place small mirrors on the monitor so that you can see any person able to view your screen.</p>

    <h2> Email security</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large; padding: 0 7em 2em 0">Email security is a term for describing different procedures and techniques for protecting email accounts, content, and  communication against unauthorized access, loss or compromise. Email is often used to spread malware, spam and phishing attacks. 
      Attackers use deceptive messages to entice recipients to part with sensitive information, open attachments or click on hyperlinks that install malware on the victim’s device. Email is also a common entry point for attackers looking to gain a foothold in an enterprise network and obtain valuable company data.
      Email encryption involves encrypting, or disguising, the content of email messages to protect potentially sensitive information from being read by anyone other than intended recipients. Email encryption often includes authentication.</p>

    <h2> Information Security </h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large; padding: 0 7em 2em 0">Information security, sometimes shortened to infosec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or at least reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate 
      access to data, or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording or devaluation of information.It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. Protected information may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical, tangible (e.g. paperwork) or intangible (e.g. knowledge). 
      Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity. This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process that involves:
      <ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large;">
      <li>Identifying information and related assets, plus potential threats, vulnerabilities and impacts;</li>
      <li>Evaluating the risks;</li>
      <li>Deciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them;</li>
      <li>Where risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them;</li>
      <li>Monitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes and improvement opportunities.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2> Internet Security </h2>  
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large; padding: 0 7em 2em 0">Internet security consists of a range of security tactics for protecting activities and transactions conducted online over the internet. 
      These tactics are meant to safeguard users from threats such as hacking into computer systems, email addresses, or websites; malicious software that can infect 
      and inherently damage systems; and identity theft by hackers who steal personal data such as bank account information and credit card numbers. </p>

    <h2> Mobile Security</h2>  
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large; padding: 0 7em 2em 0">Mobile security involves protecting both personal and business information stored on and transmitted from smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile devices. 
      The term mobile security is a broad one that covers everything from protecting mobile devices from malware threats to reducing risks and securing mobile 
      devices and their data in the case of theft, unauthorized access or accidental loss of the mobile device.</p>

    <h2> Password Security </h2>  
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large; padding: 0 7em 2em 0">Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information. The stronger your password, the more protected your computer 
      will be from hackers and malicious software. You should maintain strong passwords for all accounts on your computer.</p>

This includes protection from fire, flood, 
      natural disasters, burglary, theft, vandalism and terrorism.</p>

    <h2> Social Engineering </h2> 
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: large; padding: 0 7em 2em 0">Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. In cybercrime, these “human hacking” scams tend to lure unsuspecting users into exposing data, spreading malware infections, 
      or giving access to restricted systems.</p>
